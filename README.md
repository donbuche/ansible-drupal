### ðŸš§ **Description**

This project facilitates the deployment of Drupal applications to remote servers hosted on Okitup using Ansible. It automates the setup and configuration process, ensuring a smooth deployment workflow.
<br>
<br>

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- Ansible installed on your local machine. Follow the instructions in the following tutorial. [Ansible-drupal tutorial](https://intranet.tothomweb.com/node/342)
- Basic understanding of Drupal project structure and deployment processes.

<br>
<br>

## Dependencies

This project was bootstrapped with [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html) and [Ansistrano Deploy](https://github.com/ansistrano/deploy), as a template. Also, we used the [opdavies role](https://github.com/opdavies/ansible-role-drupal-settings)

<br>
<br>

## Usage

1. **Download installer:**

   - Run this command in your Drupal root in order to download the bash file.
     `curl -o installer.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webfer/ansible-drupal/main/scripts/installer.sh`
     This file contains custom code snippets to install this mini-application into your Drupal project.

2. **Give permissions:**

   - Make sure to give execute permissions to the downloaded file. To do this, run the following command:
     `chmod +x installer.sh`

3. **Install this application in your Drupal root:**

   - Run the following command to install Ansible within our Drupal project:
     `sudo ./installer.sh`
     Provide the password for your local machine.
     Note! Since it's an executable bash file, your local machine will prompt you for the password.

   Fantastic! You've now cloned the configuration with the necessary Ansible files onto your local machine for deployment.

   - The Tools > Ansible is the root directory inside of your Drupal project.

2. **provision_vault.yml**

   - The provision_vault.yml file contains all variables for your connection between the local machine to the remote server.

3. **ansible.cf**

   - The ansible.cf file contains additional configuration to make Ansible work as expected.

4. **vault_pass.txt**
   - The vault_pass.txt file contains the pass to encrypt/decrypt the provision_vault.yml file.
